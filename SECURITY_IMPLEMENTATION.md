# 🔐 API Key Security Implementation - COMPLETE ✅

## ✅ What Was Done

### 1. **Removed Hardcoded API Key**
- ❌ **Before**: API key exposed in source code
- ✅ **After**: API key secured with environment variables

### 2. **Added Environment Variable Support**
- 📦 Added `python-dotenv` dependency
- 🔧 Updated `agricultural_chatbot.py` to use `os.getenv()`
- 🛡️ Added comprehensive error handling for missing keys

### 3. **Created Security Infrastructure**
- 📄 `.env.example` - Template for API key configuration
- 🚫 Updated `.gitignore` - Prevents committing API keys
- 📚 `API_SETUP.md` - Complete setup instructions

### 4. **Enhanced Launch Scripts**
- 🔍 Auto-detects missing `.env` file
- 🔧 Creates `.env` from template automatically
- ⚠️ Validates API key configuration before launch

### 5. **Updated Documentation**
- 📖 Updated `README.md` with security information
- 🎯 Added security best practices
- 🚀 Clear setup instructions for new developers

## 🔒 Security Features Implemented

### Environment Variables
```env
OPENROUTER_API_KEY=sk-or-v1-your-actual-key-here
OPENROUTER_MODEL=mistralai/mistral-tiny
OPENROUTER_HTTP_REFERER=indonesian-agricultural-chatbot
```

### Error Handling
- 🚨 Clear error messages for missing API keys
- 📋 Step-by-step setup instructions in the app
- 🔧 Automatic `.env` file creation

### Git Security
- 🚫 `.env` files excluded from version control
- ✅ `.env.example` safely committed as template
- 🔐 All sensitive data protected

## 🚀 How It Works Now

### For New Users:
1. Clone repository
2. Run `./launch.sh`
3. Script creates `.env` from template
4. User adds their API key
5. Run script again to start app

### For Existing Users:
1. Add API key to `.env` file
2. Application works exactly as before
3. But with better security! 🛡️
